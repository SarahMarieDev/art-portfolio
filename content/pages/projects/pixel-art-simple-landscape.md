title: Pixel Art Simple Landscape

client: UWS - Introduction to Art / Digital Art
description: >-
  For this ART 101 project, I explored the creation of digital pixel art using
  Photoshop. I focused on setting up a small canvas, using the pencil tool for
  pixel-level painting, and preserving pixel quality when resizing. I learned
  techniques such as enabling the pixel grid, using the Nearest Neighbor
  interpolation, and creating straight lines with the shift key. The final piece
  is a simple landscape, showcasing my understanding of pixel art basics and
  setting the stage for more complex future works.
