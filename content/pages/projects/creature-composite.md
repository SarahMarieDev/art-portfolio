description: >-
  This digital composition, part of my ART 101 course, features a unique
  creature assembled from my own photos. Using Photoshop, I employed selection
  and mask tools, along with the liquify tool, to create and reshape elements
  like horns and tail feathers. Feedback led to adjustments in hue and exposure,
  adding wheels and repositioning elements for depth. The project highlights my
  ability to blend organic and mechanical elements creatively.
