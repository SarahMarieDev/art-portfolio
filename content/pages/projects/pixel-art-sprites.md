description: >-
  In this ART 101 project, I expanded on my previous pixel art work by creating
  detailed characters and objects (or "Sprites") inspired by the game "Stardew
  Valley." I focused on line work, managing "jaggies," and using anti-aliasing
  to smooth edges. To add depth, I incorporated highlights and shadows,
  particularly in the tree leaves and trunk. This project allowed me to further
  practice my skills in creating pixel sprites.
