  This digital artwork, created for my ART 101 course, showcases my skills with
  Photoshop. I used layers, masks, and filters to transform a plain photo into a
  vibrant collage. Feedback from peers helped refine the piece, incorporating
  purple tones, funky shapes, and dynamic background elements. The final result
  is a colorful, textured composition that highlights my ability to blend
  digital techniques with creative expression.
